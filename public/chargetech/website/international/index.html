    <p class="info">
      After ChargeTech's great success in Canada, we have decided to expand our business, and China seems like the ideal spot. Expanding to China would offer a significant increase in both supply and demand, and would have nearly 30 times the amount of smartphone users eligible for our product, ConstaCharge. Shipping per product costs would be greatly reduced, since many of the products would start to be made in China, the number one audience for ConstaCharge.<br /><br />ChargeTech should absolutely go international because there would be an even larger target market in China, there would be no costs for transportation because China has such high supply, and because doing so would lead to the next step to ChargeTechâ€™s success.
